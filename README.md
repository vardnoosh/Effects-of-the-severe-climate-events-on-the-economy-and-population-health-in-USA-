The goal is to explore the NOAA Storm Database and answer some questions about severe weather events.
## Synopsis
Storms and other severe weather events can cause both public health and economic problems for communities and municipalities.

This project involves exploring the U.S. National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration's (NOAA) storm database. This database tracks characteristics of major storms and weather events in the United States, including when and where they occur, as well as estimates of any fatalities, injuries, and property damage.
## The data analysis wants to address the following questions :
Across the United States, which types of events (as indicated in the EVTYPE variable) are most harmful with respect to population health ?
Across the United States, which types of events have the greatest economic consequences ?
